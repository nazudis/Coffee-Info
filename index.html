               <h1>The Milk</h1>
               <p>
                   <img src="assets/the-milk.jpg" alt="coffe latte">
                   You need cold and fresh milk. Most people prefer full fat milk for Latte Art but it is really up to you, 
                   if you use a right technique then it doesn’t make too much difference. Just make sure that the milk is fresh and straight out of the fridge. Do not expose it to heat or light before you steam it.
                   Never use the same milk again when you are working on Latte Art.
                </p>

                <h1>The Jug</h1>
                <p>
                    <img src="assets/the-jug.jpg" alt="coffe latte black">
                    Use a stainless steel jug with a narrow spout. Make sure that the jug is cold and clean before use. 
                    Fill up the jug with enough milk for your cup and make sure that you have enough milk so you have time to texture the milk. 
                    Too less milk will cause the milk to heat up too quick so a little bit more milk is better. Do not worry about the wastage too much.

            <article class="left-content">
                <h1>Thermometer</h1>
                <p>
                    <img src="assets/thermometer.jpg" alt="thermometer">
                    Use a thermometer that has a clip to attach to the jug. The thermometer should have a good size so you can easily read it. 
                    Make sure that the thermometer is adjusted right, you can do this by putting it in ice water and correcting the dial. 
                    Usually you can adjust the dial with a screw in the back. The best way to adjust your thermometer is to compare it with a digital probe. 
                    Do not place the thermometer in the dishwasher, the moisture will break your thermometer. It is also possible to judge the temperature of the milk by touch.

                <h1>Espresso</h1>
                <p>
                    <img src="assets/espresso.jpg" alt="espresso">
                    The espresso is just as important as the milk. Make sure that the espresso is fresh and has a good thick and strong layer
                     of crema. It becomes very difficult to create good Latte Art without good crema on your espresso.

        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>
            Hi and welcome to Coffee Info!
            This website is a hobby of mine and I try to post as much useful information about coffee here as possible. 
            Coffee is the second biggest industry in the world at the moment, bigger than tabaco and alcohol. We all know why… 
            because it’s so good! We drink about 2 billion cups of coffee in the world every day so we must be doing something right. 
            But… there is much to learn! <br>
            Coffee is constantly evolving and new machines and techniques are producing better tasting coffees every day. 
            Who knows where we are in the next 10 years? I think that we will stick to the espresso coffee machine with attached semi-automatic 
            grinders. Machines will evolve but the art of the barista will always stay alive (so I hope anyway).
